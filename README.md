# InitDex - Unity 2019.2.5f1
Tiny FPS Brawler mixed with fast-paced movement prototype made back in 2019 in my spare time.
Testing waters learning more about C# and new code design patterns.

-- Main Highlights --
- Acceleration based Character Controller
- Juicy Camera: Headbobbing and Tilt based on Mouse Input.
- Use of Clean Code and Interfaces.
